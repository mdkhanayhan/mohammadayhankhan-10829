## Utility of the Project

The Pattern Logic Tool helps beginners understand the use of nested loops in C programming. It is useful for practicing logical thinking and learning how numeric patterns are generated based on user input. This project strengthens core programming concepts that are important for academics, problem-solving, and technical interviews.

## Future Scope of the Project

This project can be extended to include different types of patterns such as star patterns, reverse patterns, pyramids, and diamond patterns. A menu-driven system can be added to allow users to select patterns easily. In the future, the project can also be implemented using other programming languages or enhanced with a graphical user interface.
