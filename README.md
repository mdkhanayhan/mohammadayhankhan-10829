## Project Title
**Pattern Logic Tool**

---

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to create a Pattern Logic Tool that prints number patterns based on user input using nested loops, without requiring any additional storage.

---

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of nested loops in the C programming language to generate numeric patterns. The program takes the number of rows as input from the user and prints a number pattern accordingly. No arrays or extra memory are used.

## Pattern Type
- Numeric Patterns

---

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language  
- VS Code  
- GitHub

## Algorithm / Steps
1. Decide the number of rows to be printed.
2. Take the number of rows as input from the user.
3. Use an outer loop to control the rows.
4. Use an inner loop to control the columns.
5. Use the loop counter to decide which number to print.
6. Print numbers inside the inner loop.
7. After each row, move to the next line.
8. Repeat the inner loop for every row.
9. Continue until all rows are printed.
10. No array or extra storage is required.
