## Project Title
**Pattern Logic Tool**

---

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to create a Pattern Logic Tool that prints number patterns based on user input using nested loops, without requiring any additional storage.

---

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of nested loops in the C programming language to generate numeric patterns. The program takes the number of rows as input from the user and prints a number pattern accordingly. No arrays or extra memory are used.

---

## Pattern Type
- Numeric Patterns

---

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language  
- VS Code  
- GitHub  

---

## Algorithm / Steps
1. Decide the number of rows to be printed.
2. Take the number of rows as input from the user.
3. Use an outer loop to control the rows.
4. Use an inner loop to control the columns.
5. Use the loop counter to decide which number to print.
6. Print numbers inside the inner loop.
7. After each row, move to the next line.
8. Repeat the inner loop for every row.
9. Continue until all rows are printed.
10. No array or extra storage is required.

## Utility of the Project

The Pattern Logic Tool helps beginners understand the use of nested loops in C programming. It is useful for practicing logical thinking and learning how numeric patterns are generated based on user input. This project strengthens core programming concepts that are important for academics, problem-solving, and technical interviews.

## Future Scope of the Project

This project can be extended to include different types of patterns such as star patterns, reverse patterns, pyramids, and diamond patterns. A menu-driven system can be added to allow users to select patterns easily. In the future, the project can also be implemented using other programming languages or enhanced with a graphical user interface.

## What I Learned from This Project

Through this project, I learned how to use nested loops efficiently in C programming. I gained a better understanding of loop control, user input handling, and pattern logic. I also learned how to organize a small project, write clean code, and document it properly using a README file and GitHub.
